The forest-like structure of shade coffee farms provides habitat for a great number of migratory and resident species.\n\n### Single origin\nSingle-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known geographic origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a specific collection of beans from a single country. The name of the coffee is then usually the place it was grown to whatever degree available.\n\n### Sustainable farming\nSustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.\n\n### Direct sourcing\nDirect trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some coffee roasters. Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price negotiation between buyer and farmer, along with systems that encourage and incentivize quality.\n\n### Reinvest profits\nWe want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing coffee to you. That’s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into farms, local businesses and schools everywhere our coffee is grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about coffee farming on our blog. -->","frontmatter":{"title":"We are working diligently to bring you the best products possible in the spacewear industry.","subtitle":"Interested in helping us out?
