  title: Our Vision
  description: >
    Astronaut Apparel makes superior technical apparel. We have developed fabrics which feature protection from cosmic radiation, built in moisturization, antimicrobial threads and embedded health monitors. There are many potential professional markets for technical apparel. We focus on astronauts first because of the high standards, lack of competition and high visibility. Astronauts wear cotton polos and pants which are uncomfortable, unsanitary and fit poorly in space. Our product improves the astronaut’s experience and the garment’s durability saves money on launch costs. We are first movers and our connection to the space industry, technological knowledge and patents will preserve our advantage.

  anyone.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
